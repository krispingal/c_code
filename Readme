Hi, this repository was created with the aim of implementing
most(many) of the problems ,related to data structures and 
algorithms. All of these problems are implemented in c, which
i find it easier to implement most of them.
The code i write in this based (heavily, i think) on the 
introductions to algorithms, by Thomas H. Cormen et al.
and for C I used K & R c..


Well this was my original intention but i found some questions
which was not "hard" but still interested me.
Most of the problems in misc folder are from
*geeksforgeeks
*rosettacode
*careercup
